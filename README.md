# CODE: Programming Project 03

## Getting Started
Create a Python, Java, or C++ project in whatever IDE/platform you'd like. I would normally suggest ReplitLinks to an external site., but the free version only allows 3 projects per account. So unless you're cool with creating a few accounts this semester, install an IDE for your chosen language on your computer or use platforms like Replit, CodeHSLinks to an external site., etc.

Copy the code template to your project (PythonLinks to an external site., JavaLinks to an external site., C++Links to an external site.: for each you can click the "Raw" button in the top right and get just the text to copy/paste).

Note: solutions do not need to be Object-Oriented or organized in a specific way. As long as they are organized and well documented is good enough, the template is meant to guide you and get you straight to coding!

## Programming Project
Choose one of the following options:

1) Write a program that takes a positive integer from console input and outputs the prime factorization of the integer and states whether the number is prime or composite.

2) Write a program that takes two positive integers from console input and finds their greatest common divisor using the Euclidean Algorithm. Output both the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of the two integers.

I chose option 1. I actually wrote a simple python script to implement this while working on something else a week or so ago.

I decided to implement it in Applesoft BASIC just for funsies and nostalgia. This is actually a different version of Applesoft BASIC than what I used as a kid, but it's what I've been playing around with lately in a web-basted emulator and I'm more used to it now.
